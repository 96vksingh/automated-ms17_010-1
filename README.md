# Automated-ms17_010

This is a small Repo to automate ms17_010 exploit and get the system information in the LAN

It works on all Kali distributions.

The current exploit works only for windows 7 x64 architecture.

Any contributions are welcome.

The code is still buggy

chmod +x all sh files

./start.sh gets the code to work

default interface is set as wlan0 . You can change it to eth0 in start.sh

Happy Hacking
